                <p class="about-hero-subtitle">Imagine a woman reclining against a sun-warmed rock by the Caribbean Sea, her face turned upward to the sun, sunglasses catching the light, dressed effortlessly for paradise. This is Trishiana – radiant, wise, rooted in soul and sensuality. A woman who has lived, loved, learned, and now leads. Her presence alone evokes mystery, magnetic calm, and a spirited freedom that stirs something in the hearts of women across generations.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Journey of a Soul-Driven Woman</h2>
                <p>From the time she was a child, Trishiana questioned everything. Her spirit pulsed with wonder: about life, about its mechanics, about people and their limiting beliefs. While others accepted the shadows, she searched for the light – the truths hidden beneath doctrine, silence, and societal masks.</p>
                <p>She holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from A&amp;T State University and a Master’s in Public Administration from Rutgers University. She read the King James Bible cover to cover before most had even scratched the surface, and still her hunger for deeper knowing grew.</p>
                <p>Her sacred path led her through the mystic halls of Kabbalah, Bahá’í teachings, Catharism, Rosicrucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Transcendental Meditation, Hermetic Laws, the Norse mysteries of Thor, Buddhism, indigenous ceremonies, and metaphysical truths. She danced with gods, meditated with sages, and found the divine in the mirror.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">A Life Lived as a Sensuous Pilgrimage</h2>
                <p>Trishiana is a mother who birthed a son from love, a wife who once built a life in devotion, a soul traveler who exchanged stability for wonder. She has lived abroad for over 15 years, in Panama, Costa Rica, Cuba, and now Colombia. Her footsteps have graced the earth in France, Italy, the Virgin Islands, throughout the U.S., and through the richly textured lands of Central and South America.</p>
                <p>She is a published author on Amazon and Kindle. She plays tennis, swims in the wild, and lays under the stars, anchoring her body to the earth and her heart to the heavens. When she loves—and makes love—it is from a deeply spiritual source.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">What She Offers Now</h2>
                <p>Trishiana is the guide, the mirror, and the muse. Through Sensuous-Living, she brings women home to their bodies, into a sacred relationship with their desires, and into harmony with their divine feminine force. Her voice, her art, her workshops, and her words invite women to rise—not for applause, but for embodied self-recognition.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">A Mysterious Presence That Awakens You</h2>
                <p>To be near Trishiana is to feel time slow down. There’s a mysterious rhythm in her movements, as though ancient songs play within her spirit. She wears wisdom like silk – not flaunted, but fluid, flowing through every conversation, every glance, every ritual. She doesn’t shout her presence; she allows the room to feel her. The very air seems to shimmer when she speaks, as if what she says is remembered rather than heard. She is a woman not defined by age, but by her ability to awaken your memory of wholeness.</p>
                <p>Her mission is not to lead you. It is to remind you that you already know the way—through your own breath, your pleasure, your power, and your presence.</p>
